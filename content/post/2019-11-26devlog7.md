# Analogue Art and Computational Creativity 
*[Marissa](https://marissafoley.netlify.com/) and I are setting out to co-develop a digital guerrilla public history project. These devlogs will document the creative process in all of its excitement, chaos, delight, frustration, and messiness.*

This project is ultimately a creative project. Its subjects – paintings by the Group of Seven – exist as a result of a creative output by the artists. 
We use computational tools like augmented reality to enter into a creative conversation. As such, it’s important to consider how the concept of computational creativity plays into our development process.  

“Computational Creativity causes us to rethink what computers can do, simultaneously affecting how we think of creativity in general.” – *([DH Primer]( https://carletonu.pressbooks.pub/digh5000/chapter/chapter-10-computational-creativity/))* 

In this project, we ask: how can a digital tool (AR, Aris) add to the story a painting tells? How may the use of this tool alter or change the meaning of the painting? How does it add to or disrupt the experience of the viewer? 

The process of photobashing, “a technique where many different photo manipulation techniques are applied to an original photo” *([DH Primer]( https://carletonu.pressbooks.pub/digh5000/chapter/chapter-10-computational-creativity/))* , offers us a theoretical underpinning for our work. To interact with an image through photobashing, “you think about how and why the photos were taken in particular ways, how your processes alter or engage with this and how the various remediation’s both *affect* and *effect* that relationship.” *(Copplestone via [DH Primer]( https://carletonu.pressbooks.pub/digh5000/chapter/chapter-10-computational-creativity/))*

We are doing a form of photobashing – paintingbashing, maybe?  Through this process, we will affect and effect the paintings, see them in new ways, and take time with all the minute choices the artists made while doing the paintings. If we accomplish our task well enough, we will be able to share some of these new ways of seeing through our own interventions. 

However, we must consider also that we are paintingbashing Group of Seven paintings with a particular narrative in mind: climate change and environmental degradation. Through our bashing, we will be doing a very close reading of each one of the paintings in terms of how that artist may have chosen to think about these subjects themselves. 

No stage of creativity during this project should be held in higher regard than the others – as art pieces, our interventions will be equally analogue as they are digital. We have decided to create our interventions with analogue tools rather than digital. We feel we can enter into conversations with the paintings more meaningfully through artistic mediums we are familiar with – in particular, our artistic practices are centered around watercolour and acrylic painting, collage, and printmaking. It is with some or all of these techniques that we will make our marks on the chosen paintings from the National Gallery’s collection. 

As we cannot (and wouldn’t want to) paint/collage/print overtop of actual Group of Seven paintings, the machine necessarily facilitates the encounter between two analogue art projects – the ones created a hundred years ago, and our own creations from today. The computer acts as an essential tool of creativity and art-making.
