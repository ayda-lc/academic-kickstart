# AR Mock-Ups
## [Marissa](https://marissafoley.netlify.com/) and I are setting out to co-develop a digital guerrilla public history project. These devlogs will document the creative process in all of its excitement, chaos, delight, frustration, and messiness.

### The following are mock-ups of possible images and themes to develop. They were all sketched quickly during the gallery visit on an iPhone, and are meant to serve as inspiration, not necessarily what the final AR interventions will look like. All paintings are from the National Gallery of Canada's permanant collection - search the online collection yourself [here](https://www.gallery.ca/collection/search-the-collection).
