# Ethics and iOS 
*[Marissa](https://marissafoley.netlify.com/) and I are setting out to co-develop a digital guerrilla public history project. These devlogs will document the creative process in all of its excitement, chaos, delight, frustration, and messiness.*

**What are the eithical concerns of the tools we're using?**

The ARIS app only runs on iOS platforms. Apple has a long history of human rights issues, bad labour practices, and other ethical violations. I'd like to take some time to consider two of the major drawbacks to using an iOS-only platform. 

**1) Privilege & access** 

Apple devices have high price points and it takes a fair amount of economic privilege to have access to them. By using an applicaiton that only runs on iOS devices, we exclude people who do not have an iPhone or an iPad from the expereince. 

It's also worth mentioning that the issue of privilege and access doesn't start and end with the digital tool we're using - the space where our experience is set acts as a gatekeeper as well. We have chosen to set the experience in the National Gallery of Canada. As a large art institution, not only does it usually cost money to enter, but the space itself may be alienating to many people. 


**2) Environmental impact**

As we focus on the climate crisis in this project, we would be remiss not to consider the environmental impact of Apple's mining and manufacturing processes. Apple's marketing strategies and business model implicitly and explicitly renders 'old' models quickly obselete, a major factor in the production/consumption/waste chain of Apple products. E-waste also offers unique environmental concerns because of the harmful materials that electronics contain.  

*Could we make reference to some of this in our AR interventions?* 

Maybe one of our images could explicitly deal with Apple's environmental impact - this could be a really interesting way to turn the attention back on to the user of the app, and prompt serious reflection about our own consumer choices.
