# Testing ARIS 
## [Marissa](https://marissafoley.netlify.com/) and I are setting out to co-develop a digital guerrilla public history project. These devlogs will document the creative process in all of its excitement, chaos, delight, frustration, and messiness.

This afternoon I tested out the [ARIS](https://fielddaylab.org/make/aris/) game developer & app to see if it will be a good tool to build our augmented reality intervention with. I used the [Field Day tutorial](https://fielddaylab.wisc.edu/courses/aris-ar) on Augmented Reality in ARIS to take me through the process.

I had to start with a trigger image. I figured that since we'll be working with paintings in this project, I should do this test with a painting. I chose this small acrylic piece I bought from an artist in Guatemala. I would love to be able to give further credit but unfortunately, I don't remember their name and the work is unsigned.

I uploaded this test image to [vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/) and it got a five star rating - which apparently means it should be a good image to play around with AR. From there I downloaded a .zip file of this trigger image (I could do this with a whole database of images, as well) to put into ARIS. 

Following this, I had to decide what I wanted my AR alteration to be. I began by removing some of the background of the painting on the Preview app on my computer.

I found a film photo that my sister took of a street corner in Antigua, and decided to use it as a new background for the figures in this little painting.

Once I had overlayed the two images, I uploaded it to the "media" section, created a plaque to view it in, and set up the AR triggers all within my test game in the ARIS builder on my computer.

Then came the moment of truth - testing the trigger within the ARIS app on my phone. My first try, the image wouldn't register and nothing seemed to be happening. My first instinct when something doesn't work is to quit, restart, and try again - and the AR trigger immediately worked! 

Overall, I'm really happy with the useability of ARIS, and now that I've gone through the basics, I look forward to exploring it further to understand the capabilities and limitations of this platform.
